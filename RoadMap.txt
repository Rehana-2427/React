Awesome! Here's a **complete and logically structured React learning roadmap** that includes **everything you listed**, **corrected and expanded**, and **in the best order to study**—starting from basics to advanced topics. I’ve also added a few **essential missing concepts** (like testing, performance optimization, error boundaries, TypeScript integration, etc.).
