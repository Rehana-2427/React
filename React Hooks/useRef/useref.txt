### ðŸ”¹ `useRef`
- Managing Focus & DOM access
- Storing mutable values

useRef -> 
it is uses reference (heap memory reference)
non-primitive data types store in heap memory, instead of holding data directly it holds address(memory reference)

inside a functional component ,when we create a non primitive data that data can be hold only one reference throughout the life cycle of functional component 

useRef  uses 
to access real DOM elements
to add custom event listeners on real DOM elements
mutations


in react for every elements  one attribute is there called ref 
ref=> takes object (ref{current:value})
