📦 What is a Component in React?

components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) 
and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
A component is a reusable piece of code in React that returns some UI (User Interface).

It can be small (like a button) or big (like a whole page).

Think of it like building blocks — you build your app by combining many small blocks (components).

Example:
Navbar, Footer, LoginForm, HomePage — all can be components!

Navbar.jsx - 	Contains only the Navbar UI and logic (example: logo, menu links)
Footer.jsx -	Contains only the Footer UI and logic (example: copyright, links)
Content.jsx -	Contains only the Main content (example: welcome text, images)
Home.js	- Combines all three components together to build the full Home page

📁 Folder Structure Example

src/
 ├── components/
 │     ├── Navbar.jsx
 │     ├── Footer.jsx
 │     └── Content.jsx
 └── pages/
       └── Home.js

⚡ How it works?

1. Navbar.jsx
import React from 'react';

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <h1>My Website</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}

export default Navbar;

2. Content.jsx

import React from 'react';

function Content() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h2>Welcome to the Home Page!</h2>
      <p>This is the main content area.</p>
    </main>
  );
}

export default Content;

3. Footer.jsx

import React from 'react';

function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      <p>© 2025 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
  );
}

export default Footer;

4. Home.js

import React from 'react';
import Navbar from '../components/Navbar';
import Content from '../components/Content';
import Footer from '../components/Footer';

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar />
      <Content />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}

export default Home;


You split big page (Home) into small reusable components (Navbar, Content, Footer).

Each component is separate for better organization and maintenance.

Home.js just calls/imports these smaller pieces and renders them together.

This is called Component-Based Architecture 


✅ Benefits:

✅ Reusability — Write once, use anywhere.
✅ Separation of Concerns — Each component does one thing (example: Navbar only handles navigation).
✅ Maintainability — Easy to find and fix bugs because everything is organized.
✅ Scalability — You can easily add more features by adding more components without breaking the existing app.

There are mainly 2 types:

1.Functional components
